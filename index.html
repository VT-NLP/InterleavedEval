            <p class="dataset_description"> Interleaved text-and-image generation has been an intriguing research direction, where the models are required to generate both images and text pieces in an arbitrary order. Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation. We carefully define five essential evaluation aspects for InterleavedEval, including text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness, to ensure a comprehensive and fine-grained assessment. Through extensive experiments and rigorous human evaluation, we show that our benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate the existing models with a strong correlation with human judgments surpassing previous reference-based metrics. We also provide substantial findings and insights to foster future research in interleaved generation and its evaluation.

            <p class="dataset_description">To ensure the coverage and quality of tasks, we proposed an annotation pipeline as demonstrated in the above figure. First, the authors search on the internet to identify interesting vision-language tasks. Second, the tasks are assigned to the annotators and the annotators write download and preprocessing scripts to prepare the data. Once the dataset is processed into the required format, the authors and annotators start discuss potential tasks that can be derived from the existing annotations. Third, the annotators write instructions and templates for each task and the authors provide feedbacks for revising the instructions. This step can repeat multiple times until the instructions meet the requirement. Forth, the annotators upload the processed datasets and instructions to our database. Finally, the authors double-check the correctness of the instructions, images and outputs. The authors also check the grammar and fluency of the instructions. All the annotators are graduate computer science students who have strong background in machine learning and deep learning.

            <p class="dataset_description">We provide the download links to the annotations and images above. In the annotations file, we merged instructions and templates with original tasks' inputs and outputs. To train a model on InterleavedEval, you can simply download the annotations and images. The annotations file consists of 191 tasks and for each task we randomly sampled 1K instances which should be sufficient for the purpose of instruction tuning. By now we can not release all tasks since some datasets are not allowed to be distributed.
